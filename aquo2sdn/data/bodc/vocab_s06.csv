"S0600269";"Transparency class";"4/25/2021 23:44:36";"";"A character string defining the transparency, opacity or translucency of an object in a classification."
"S0600270";"Size category";"4/26/2021 17:56:09";"";"Terms used in the construction of a complex variable description when the objects of interest need to be grouped according to their size. These categories may be expressed as text (e.g. "small", "large") or size intervals (e.g. ">200um", "20-20um"). It is recommended that the result be constrained by a controlled vocabulary such as [S09] (http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S09/current/) for biological objects."

"S0600273";"Sauter mean diameter";"6/16/2021 12:47:17";"SMD";"An average of particle size determined as the average diameter of a collection of spherical particles that have the same volume/surface area ratio as a particle of interest."
"S0600274";"Pressure";"6/16/2021 12:56:15";"";"Force per unit area applied in the direction perpendicular to a surface. For pressure measurements used to express the depth (vertical coordinate) in a water body use SDN:S06::S0600168."

"S0600280";"pH (NBS scale)";"11/1/2021 11:53:00";"";"A measure of acidity based on the National Bureau of Standards' operational pH scale which denotes the negative of the common logarithm of the free proton (hydrogen ion) activity, -log ag."
"S0600281";"pH (unspecified scale)";"11/8/2021 13:40:44";"";"A measure of acidity where the scale is either unknown or not specified."
"S0600282";"Enrichment with respect to VCDT";"2/17/2022 21:04:04";"";"The change in the relative abundance of an isotope of a given element relative to its relative abundance in the Vienna Canyon Diablo Troilite (VCDT) international measurement standard, also known as IAEA-S-1 and formerly known as NZ-1 (NIST 8554), a reference material for relative sulfur isotope ratio measurements."
"S0600283";"Total alkalinity";"3/22/2022 13:32:29";"";"The acid-neutralising capacity of solutes in an aqueous system or sample."
