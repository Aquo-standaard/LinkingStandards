"S23C001";"unknown";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The correct value is not known to and not computable by the creator of this information. However a correct value probably exists."
"S23C003";"particulate";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The portion of an aqueous sphere (water bodies, pore water, rainwater) that is retained as residue on a conventional filter."
"S23C004";"colloidal";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The portion of an aqueous sphere (water bodies, pore water, rainwater) that is retained as residue on a ultra-fine filter after other particles have been removed by a conventional filter."
"S23C005";"aerosol";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The portion of atmosphere that may be retained by physical retention. This may be either solids or liquid droplets."
"S23C007";"non-algal particle";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The portion of a solid sphere (SPM or sediment) that is not made up from lower plant material."
"S23C008";"not applicable";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"There is no appropriate value for the phase of the sphere. In other words, the sphere cannot be or has not been physically subdivided into component parts."
"S23C009";"pigment";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The portion of a solid sphere (SPM or sediment) that is not made up from material that changes the colour of reflected or transmitted light."
"S23C010";"dissolved plus reactive particulate";"6/11/2018 12:13:02";"";"The portion of an aqueous sphere (water bodies, pore water, rainwater) that passes through a filter or that sphere in its entirety (i.e. unfiltered water). It comprises liquid plus solid particles smaller than a designated size (or all sizes) that may or may not contribute to the magnitude of the analyte assay."
"S23C011";"heavy fraction";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The portion of the sphere that is denser than bromoform."
"S23C012";"light fraction";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The portion of the sphere that is less dense than bromoform."
"S23C013";"gaseous";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The portion of atmosphere that is neither solids nor liquid droplets."
"S23C014";"amorphous";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The portion of the sphere that is solid but not crystalline."
"S23C015";"non-carbonate";"3/13/2014 08:21:44";"";"The portion of a solid sphere (SPM or sediment) that remains after digestion by a mineral acid such as HCl (but not HF)."
"S23C021";"biogenic carbonate";"3/27/2014 00:16:03";"";"The portion of a solid sphere (SPM or sediment) that is composed of carbonates (primarily calcium carbonate) that originated as internal or external skeletal units of plants or animals."
