The float is connected to the large drum in the lower centre of the picture and the counter weight connected to the smaller drum on its right. This difference in drum size means the counter weight does not enter the seawater on every tide. The disadvantage is that the counter weight has to be proportionally heavier to counter balance the float. The pen arm is moved up and down the chart by means of a chain loop linked to a worm gear on the drum axle."
"TOOL0011";"Bubbler tide gauge";"11/28/2008 07:54:28";"Bubbler";"The full tide bubbler system normally consists of two independent measuring systems. The pressure points are mounted approx 1m below Admiralty Chart Datum (ACD) so that negative surges may be recorded and are similar in appearance to an inverted bucket with a copper nozzle mounted on the side. This nozzle is the actual measuring point. A low flow of dry air (normally 7ml/min) is fed down an air tube to the top of the pressure point. When the air pressure in the air line equals the pressure exerted by the column of water above it, then the excess air is released as bubbles through the copper nozzle. This means that the pressure in the air line is proportional to the weight of the water column."
"TOOL0012";"Mid-tide bubbler tide gauge";"11/30/2009 11:27:51";"Mid-tide bubbler";"The operation of the mid tide bubbler is similar to that of the full tide system, except that the measuring point is mounted at the mid tide height. This means that the pressure point is only immersed for half of the tidal cycle. The reason for this is that when the measuring point is exposed it can be accurately levelled into the geodetic network. Once this is accomplished the full tide pressure points can be fitted to match the tidal curve produced by the mid tide pressure point, thereby connecting them to the geodetic network."
"TOOL0013";"Dataring pressure point transducer";"11/28/2008 07:54:41";"Pressure point";"The Dataring pressure point comprises differential transducers contained in a watertight housing. The reference port is vented to atmosphere via the power supply and signal cable tube, while the measuring port of the transducer is connected to a copper outlet nozzle on the top of the transducer housing. The copper nozzle, transducer measuring port and connecting tube are filled with oil so the pressure is transmitted to the crystal element via the oil, thus keeping the transducer components free from the effects of the saltwater."
"TOOL0014";"Munro tide gauge";"11/28/2008 07:54:52";"Munro gauge";"The Munro gauge measures sea level by means of a float in a stilling well. The float is about 45cm in diameter - the large diameter reduces inevitable errors in buoyancy due to friction of the gearing and small changes in the length of float wire. This wire is coiled round a drum on the end of the gauge and another drum contains a counter balance wire. The drum is geared to a slotted tape attached to a pen carriage which traces the tide curve on the chart during the rise and fall of the tide. A precision potentiometer is attached to the gauge to provide an input to the data logger."
"TOOL0015";"Wellhead tide gauge";"11/30/2009 11:27:51";"Wellhead gauge";"The Wellhead gauge measures the sea level by means of a float in a stilling well. The float is usually of a smaller diameter than that used on a Munro gauge (about 45cm diameter), and has a counterweight attached to a smaller diameter pulley than that of the float so it is not immersed in the sea when the float rises. The Wellhead unit does not produce a chart but does give a readout of the height. It is interfaced to the data logger via a precision potentiometer."
"TOOL0016";"Ott pneumatic tide gauge";"11/30/2009 11:27:51";"Ott gauge";"The Ott pneumatic gauge derives its measuring signal from the pressure produced in a bubbler system. The pressure is applied to one end of a pivoted beam. On the other side of the pivot is a weight which is moved up and down the beam by an electric motor in order to counter balance the pressure signal. At the far end of the beam are electrical contacts which operate the motor in the correct sense when the beam moves out of balance.   The motor is also geared to a double helix shaft with the pen arm attached. The position of the pen is therefore proportional to the applied air pressure."

"TOOL0405";"National Marine Facilities Microelectrode Oxygen Sensor";"7/27/2011 14:50:44";"NMF Microelectrode DO";"A non-membrane dissolved oxygen sensor for marine applications. The sensor uses a platinum microelectrode and a counter electrode (thus far composed of copper). A measurement potential is applied to the microelectrode relative to a counter electrode, reducing the dissolved oxygen in the water and generating a current through the microelectrode proportional to the number of oxygen molecules at that electrode. The sensor was first used in 2000 and development is ongoing. Early versions of the instrument applied the measurement potential for up to 30 seconds, with sampling starting approximately one second after the potential was applied. The sensor response to oxygen remained almost constant for a given concentration and data could be sampled at frequencies exceeding 1 Hz. To reduce noise generated by sensitivity to flow fluctuations a mesoporous layer was used to increase the surface area of the microelectrode, but this proved unstable and was replaced by a stop-flow system which pumped water in to a very small chamber, with measurements being taken while the water was still. This significantly improved results but the sensor was still affected by small convection currents. The current version of the sensor only applies the measurement potential for a few 10s of milliseconds and data are collected at approximately 1 Hz in an attempt to minimise the effects of convection currents. The latest development is a very small sensor head containing an array of microelectrodes (currently an array of five) that work together. The counter electrode consists of silver or silver chloride.

The OMI observes Earth's solar backscattered radiation in the visible and ultraviolet spectrums with a wide-field telescope, using hyperspectral imaging in a push-broom mode. This feeds two imaging grating spectrometers, each of which employs a charged coupled device (CCD) detector. Onboard calibration includes a white light source, LEDs, and a multi-surface solar-calibration diffuser. A depolariser removes the polarisation from the backscattered radiation. The OMI has a 13 x 24 km spatial resolution which can be zoomed to 13 x 13 km for detecting and tracking urban-scale pollution sources. The OMI employs three spectral bands, with wavelengths detected in the visible spectrum from 350 - 500 nm (band 1) and wavelengths detected in the ultraviolet spectrum from 270 - 314 nm (band 2) and  306 - 380 nm (band 3).

It operates in the visible, near-infrared and near-ultraviolet spectrums.  The OSIRIS instrument is essentially two optical subsystems, suggested by its name: an optical spectrograph (OS) module and an infrared imager (IRI) module. The OS is a grating spectrometer with a CCD (charged coupled device) detector. Vertical profiles of the limb radiance are obtained by taking OS exposures while performing a repetitive vertical scan of the single line-of-sight through selected tangent altitude ranges (10 - 100 km). The IRI is composed of three vertical near infrared co-aligned linear array imagers that capture one-dimensional images of the limb radiance with a tangent altitude resolution of approximately 1 km. The imagers have parallel bore-sights; each one consists of an identical baffling system, lens, narrow-band interference filter, and a one-dimensional linear array of 128 thermo-electrically cooled photodetectors placed in the focal plane of the lens. Approximately 30 photodetector elements at one end of each array are covered with a mask in order to provide a continuous measure of the dark signal in the array. Therefore there are approximately 100 lines of sight from each imager channel that measure simultaneously over 100 vertical kilometres in tangent altitude. OSIRIS (OS) has a spectral range of 280 - 800 nm and a spectral resolution of 1 nm when at an altitude range of 5 -100 km. Each scan takes 40 - 70 seconds.

It measures microwave energy emitted by the Earth and atmosphere to quantify the water vapour, cloud water, rainfall intensity and rainfall rates in the atmosphere. The TMI design is based on the SSM/I, detecting microwave energy in the form of of brightness temperatures from Earth's surface and atmosphere. It measures this at five separate frequencies. TMI consists of nine separate total-power radiometers, each simultaneously measuring the microwave emission coming from the Earth's surface with the intervening atmosphere. TMI employs an offset parabolic reflector (antenna aperture size of 61 cm) to collect the microwave radiation. The reflector focuses the radiation into two feedhorn. The reflector and feedhorns spin as a unit about an axis parallel to the S/X nadir direction. A cold-space mirror and a warm reference load are attached to the spin axis and do not rotate. The rotating feedhorns observe the fixed cold mirror and warm load once each scan for calibration purposes. The TMI measures radiation intensity at 10.7, 19.4, 21.3, 37 and 85.5 GHz. It has a resolution ranging from 7 km x 5 km to 63 km x 37 km depending on the frequency used, and a feedhorn-reflector rotation period of 1.9 s.

It measures the spectral signature of chlorophyll, and also detects soil moisture and vegetation for the characterization and correction of atmospheric effects on reflectance. This information is used for measurements of vegetation canopies, either for scientific studies involving both regional and global scale experiments (for example development of models of biosphere dynamics interacting with climate models), or for monitoring crops, pastures and forests. The instrument collects radiation reflected by the earth's surface to convert it into usable electrical signals. Silicon linear arrays are used for spectral band B0 (Blue), B2 (Red) and B3 (Near-Infrared), while InGaAs linear array is used for the Short Wave Infrared spectral band. Each array features 1728 individual CCD detectors. The output voltage signals are fed to a multiplexer (beforehand SWIR voltages are adjusted for dark current values), then to a single analogue to digital converter (ADC). All sensors are processed by a single high precision 11 bit ADC, thus completely by-passing the problem of electronic interband calibration. VEGETATION operates in the following spectrums: blue (0.43-0.47 micrometres), red (0.61-0.68 micrometres), near-infrared (0.78-0.89 micrometres) and shortwave-infrared (1.58-1.75 micrometres).

WindSat is also used to measure soil moisture, sea ice and tropical cyclone structure. WindSat uses a 1.8 m offset reflector antenna fed by 11 dual-polarised feed horns. The antenna beams view the Earth at incidence angles ranging from 50 to 55 degrees. The feedhorns of each frequency channel trace out different arcs along the scan, therefore the Earth Incidence Angles (EIA) are different for each frequency band. The WindSat sensor takes observations during both the forward and aft looking scans. The 10.7, 18.7 and 37.0 GHz bands are fully polarimetric. Six principal polarisations are measured directly using three dual polarisation feeds at each of the polarimetric frequencies. The 6.8 and 23.8 GHz channels are dual-polarised as data at these frequencies are used for secondary parameters such as sea surface temperature and water vapour, which support the wind vector retrievals. WindSat operates in discrete bands at frequencies of 6.8, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8, and 37.0 GHz. The antenna rotates at 30 rpm.

The SAR radar operates by obtaining strips of imagery in two modes: the imaging mode, and the wave mode. In imaging mode, SAR provides two-dimensional images between (6 - 30)m along-track at a spatial resolution of 26m. In wave mode, imagettes of 5 km by 5 km in size are captured at regular intervals of 200 km along track; the imagettes are then processed within the swath to obtain the wave spectra, as changes in radar reflectivity on the sea surface are proxies for length and direction of surface waves. SCAT is composed by three sideways-looking antennas which generate radar beams at 45, 90 and 135 degrees azimuth across a swath 500 km wide situated 200 km to the right of the sub-satellite track. The radar backscatter is then measured for overlapping cells of 50 km resolution, using a grid spacing of 25 km.

Reflected visible light is converged via two objective lenses to magnify the view, which is initially inverted. An erect (non-inverted) image is achieved either by an erecting lens or a prism. Porro prism binoculars use a pair of porro prisms in a Z configuration to erect the image, offering a bright image and good depth sensation. Roof prism binoculars are more compact as the objectives lenses are in line with the eyepieces, but produce images with reduced brightness. Very small instruments may be of the Galilean type, which yields an erect image using a positive objective lens and a negative eyepiece lens.

ISIIS systems image organisms and particles in-situ as they swim or flow in between its two pods (fitted with a camera and illumination system). The instrument captures images of mostly undisturbed organisms, at a fine spatial and temporal resolution. ISIIS is an underwater imaging system for capturing in situ, real time images of marine zooplankton of relatively low abundance such as fish larvae and fragile gelatinous organisms. ISIIS imaging systems use industrial grade cameras. On towed sleds, they use a line-scan camera creating one single continuous image representing a real slice of the ocean. However, they can also be fitted with a classic area-scan camera if a system is to be used still (underwater monitoring station) or do slow vertical profiles. The ISIIS system utilizes a high-resolution line-scanning camera with a Light Emitting Diode (LED) light source, modified by plano-convex optics, to create a collimated light field to backlight a parcel of water. The imaged parcel of water passes between the forward portions of two streamlined pods (UW housings), and thereby remains unaffected by turbulence. The resulting very high-resolution image is of plankton in their natural position and orientation. When a sufficient volume of water is imaged this way, quantification of density and fine-scale distribution is possible. ISIIS is capable of imaging a maximum of 162 L of water per second (when flying at 5 knots) with a pixel resolution of 70 um, imaging particles from 1 mm to 13 cm in size."

The instrument may be mounted on a towed vehicle such as Chelsea Technologies Group's AQUAshuttle III, NvShuttle or SeaSoar, it can be deployed on buoys, on a mooring, or vertically in a profiling mode. The fluorimeter uses a pulsed light double beam technique. The pulsed technique allows virtually perfect discrimination to be achieved against "steady" ambient light signals since the light pulse is only two microseconds long, variations in ambient intensity due to wave glitter, etc. are considered "steady" by the high-speed processing circuits and are effectively rejected by the AQUAtracka. The double beam system allows the light intensity of the optical beam(X) returned from the specimen to be compared with the light intensity of the reference beam(Y) generated from the same pulsed light source. The outputs are then ratioed(X/Y) so that they are not affected by any variations in the flash lamp strength due to lamp ageing.
