105;Secchi schijf;TOOL0430;http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL0430/;Secchi disk;A circular disk, typically 20cm in diameter, used to measure water transparency. For marine applications, the disk is usually entirely white, while for limnological studies it is common to use one with alternating black and white quadrants. The reasons for this may be historical rather thah theoretical. A black Secchi disk has recently been developed for use in shallow rivers and streams. The disk is lowered slowly into the water on a pole or line until it can no longer be seen by the observer. The depth of disappearance provides an estimate of the transparency of the water, although any reading is affected by the observer's eyesight and ambient light conditions.;02/11/2011;;;;;

106;Troebelheidsmeter;TOOL1985;http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/L22/current/TOOL1985/;Unspecified light scattering sensor;An optical sensor designed to estimate particle abundance in seawater. This relatively simple and inexpensive instrument is best suited for use in high turbidity waters, as well as for the detection of deep-sea hydrothermal plumes. Its raw output is in volts, which can be converted into nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). The light scattering sensor consists of a light source and a detector mounted side by side. It operates by detecting the light scattered backwards by particles suspended in the water.;24/08/2023;;;;;
